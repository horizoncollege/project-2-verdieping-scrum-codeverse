Webpage instuctions:
When you open the page you are first introduced by the login screen. An account is needed to use the page, you can login or create an account at the register page (links is found below the login page).

When you are logged in you are directed to the index page where you can see the public repositories of other people, you can see the tags and name of the repositories there.

If you click on a repository it redirects you to the detail page of that repository, in that detail page you can see the code, the tags, the date and te author of the repository.

If you go to account there is a dropdown with the options: logout and my codes.
If you logout the session is ended and when you login again the session starts again.

At my codes you can see your own repositories both public and private, if you click on a repository you see the details, then you see a button called "edit" there you can edit the repsitory.


Known isseus:
